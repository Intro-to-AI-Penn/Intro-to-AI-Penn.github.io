        Artificial intelligence is reshaping how we learn, create, and make decisions. 
        This course offers a broad, accessible introduction to how AI works, what it can 
        and cannot do, and where it might be headed. It is a self-contained guide to 
        “everything you need to know about AI”, whether you’re a senior about to step 
        into the real world or a first-year student eager to use AI for learning, research, 
        and life.
        </p>
        <p>
        Students will gain an intuitive understanding of how modern AI systems, especially generative AI, 
        learn from data and produce language, images, and ideas. Through hands-on exercises with accessible 
        AI tools, they will explore data, language, and visualization — and experience how AI systems 
        generate text and art. The course will also address the risks AI poses to individuals and society, 
        helping students recognize their origins and consider how they can be mitigated.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the second half of the semester, students will survey real-world applications of AI across fields, 
        from healthcare and finance to art and design, and discuss what it means to live and work in an 
        AI-infused world. Guest speakers, readings, and class debates will expose students to a range of 
        perspectives on AI’s power and promise.
        </p>
        <p>
        The course has no prerequisites. Its content will evolve each semester as the field itself changes. 
        A team of faculty from Arts & Sciences and other Penn schools co-teach the course so that students 
        can learn directly from leading experts in different fields. Each 90-minute session includes a 60-minute 
        lecture and discussion followed by an interactive activity, which will span hands-on experiments with 
        data and visualization, creating content and art, or role playing exercises. The “AI in the Real World” 
        modules feature guest appearances by practitioners from diverse professions.
        </p>

        <h3>Readings</h3>
        <p>
            <em>
                <a href="https://melaniemitchell.me/aibook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                Artificial Intelligence – A Guide for Thinking Humans
                </a>
            </em>

            by Melanie Mitchell (used in the early weeks), 
            plus selected articles, blogs, videos, and 
            podcasts assigned weekly.

        </p>

        <h3>Attendance and Grading</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Attendance and in-class exercises:</strong> 60%</li>
        <li><strong>Readings and related Q&amp;A:</strong> 20%</li>
        <li><strong>Midterm/final quiz:</strong> 20%</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Attendance is required; please email in advance for any class you cannot attend. The readings should take about 2 hours per week,
        including follow-ups to in-class exercises. There will be no other homework. The two quizzes are designed to be easy if you have
        participated in class and completed the readings.
        </p>

        <h3>AI Policy</h3>
        <p>
        For most of the time in class you will not need to use any kind of AI. We will use AI for some in-class exercises, and I will
        indicate those explicitly. So the default during class is: <strong>no AI please</strong>. This may seem odd for an AI course,
        but our goal is to learn—and that involves a balancing act.
        </p>

        <p>
        When you submit work, please cite whenever you use an AI product and name the product (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, etc.). If you used
        AI for only part of the process (like brainstorming), indicate that too. For quizzes, no AI is to be used unless explicitly stated.
        </p>
